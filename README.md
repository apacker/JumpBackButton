This extension allows a user to navigate back in their browser history,
skipping over pages with a URL that match the current page URL up to its
final directory. As an example, the JumpBack Button can be used to
return to a Yelp search after navigating through photos of a restaurant.
 Also useful for websites that contain articles told in slideshow format.
